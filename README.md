# User Auth React App & Websocket NodeJS server Example #

## Objectives ##
The objective of this react app is to show a fast and easy approach to user authentication using React and a nodejs server.

## Technologies used ##
* React
* Webpack
* Babel & transformation plugins (see .babelrc for more info)
* NodeJS
* Websocket
* Redis
* Security (optional)
  * nsp - Optional but good to check for potential vulns in NPM packages.
  * Helmet - good practice to not disclose too much information to attackers.
  * RateLimit - Always good practice to rate limit requests against availability and brute force attacks.
* eslint
* flow

## Why not just create-react-app? ##
I'm old school and somehow need to get into the configuration details, something that **create-react-app** hides pretty well.
